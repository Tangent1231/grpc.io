[Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org) is an open source network protocol
analyzer that can be used for protocol development, network troubleshooting, and
education. Wireshark lets you analyze gRPC messages that are transferred over
the network, and learn about the binary format of these messages.

In this post, you'll learn how to configure and use the Wireshark [gRPC
dissector][] and the [Protocol Buffers (Protobuf) dissector][], which are
protocol-specific components that allow you to analyze gRPC messages with
Wireshark.

## Features

The main features of the gRPC and Protobuf dissectors are the following:

- Support dissecting (decoding) gRPC messages serialized in the
  [protocol buffer wire format][] or as JSON

- Support dissecting gRPC messages of unary, server streaming, client streaming,
  and bidirectional streaming RPC calls

- Enhanced dissection of serialized protocol buffers data by allowing
  you to do the following:
  - Load relevant `.proto` files
  - Register your own subdissectors for protocol buffer fields of type `byte` or
    `string`

## Capturing gRPC traffic

This post focuses on the analysis of captured gRPC messages. To learn how to
store network traffic in _capture files_, see [Capturing Live Network Data][]
from the [Wireshark User’s Guide][].

{{< alert title="Note" color="info" >}}
  Currently, Wireshark can only parse **plain text** gRPC messages. While
  [Wireshark supports TLS dissection][], it requires per-session secret keys. As
  of the time of writing, gRPC libraries do not support the exporting of such
  keys.

## Example

As an example, let's walk through the setup necessary to analyze
previously-captured messages, which were generated by a slightly extended
version of the _address book_ app used in the [Protocol Buffers tutorials][].

### Address book `.proto` files

The app's main protocol file is `addressbook.proto`:

```protobuf
syntax = "proto3";
package tutorial;
import "google/protobuf/timestamp.proto";

message Person {
  string name = 1;
  int32 id = 2;  // Unique ID number for this person.
  string email = 3;

  enum PhoneType {
    MOBILE = 0;
    HOME = 1;
    WORK = 2;
  }

  message PhoneNumber {
    string number = 1;
    PhoneType type = 2;
  }

  repeated PhoneNumber phone = 4;
  google.protobuf.Timestamp last_updated = 5;
  bytes portrait_image = 6;
}

message AddressBook {
  repeated Person people = 1;
}
```

This file is identical to the [Protocol Buffers tutorial version][pb-ab.proto],
except for the additional `portrait_image` field.

Note the import statement at the top of the file, it is used to import
`Timestamp`, which is one of many [Protocol Buffers Well-Known Types][].

Our variant of the app also defines a _person-search_ service that can be used to
search for address book entries based on certain attributes. The service is
defined in `person_search_service.proto`:

```protobuf
syntax = "proto3";
package tutorial;
import "addressbook.proto";

message PersonSearchRequest {
  repeated string name = 1;
  repeated int32 id = 2;
  repeated string phoneNumber = 3;
}

service PersonSearchService {
  rpc Search (PersonSearchRequest) returns (stream Person) {}
}
```

This file also has an import statement, this is because the service uses the
`Person` type defined in `addressbook.proto`.

### Setting protobuf search paths

You'll get the most meaningful decodings when Wireshark knows about the `.proto`
files used by the apps whose messages you are analyzing.

You tell Wireshark where to find `.proto` files by setting the **Protobuf Search
Paths** in the Protobuf preferences accessible from the **Edit** menu under
**Preferences > Protocols > Protobuf**.

If our example app's `.proto` files are in directory `d:/protos/my_proto_files`
and the official Protobuf library directory is
`d:/protos/protobuf-3.4.1/include`, then add these to paths as source
directories like this:

![wireshark_protobuf_search_paths](/img/wireshark_protobuf_search_paths.png)

By selecting the **Load all files** option for the app's protocol directory you
enable preloading of message definitions from the `addressbook.proto` file.

### gRPC Sample Capture files

There are two gRPC sample capture files
[grpc_person_search_protobuf_with_image.pcapng](https://gitlab.com/wireshark/wireshark/-/wikis/uploads/f6fcdceb0248669c0b057bd15d45ab6f/grpc_person_search_protobuf_with_image.pcapng)
and
[grpc_person_search_json_with_image.pcapng](https://gitlab.com/wireshark/wireshark/-/wikis/uploads/88c03db83efb2e3253c88f853d40477b/grpc_person_search_json_with_image.pcapng)
on the [SampleCaptures
page](https://gitlab.com/wireshark/wireshark/-/wikis/SampleCaptures) of
Wireshark. The difference between the two captures is that the message of former
is serialized in Protobuf, and the latter is serialized in JSON.

To decode sample captures as gRPC message, you must decode the traffic on TCP
port 50051 and 50052 as HTTP2:
![wireshark_decode_as_dialog](/img/wireshark_decode_as_dialog.png)

This is a screenshot of the gRPC service request message of
[grpc_person_search_protobuf_with_image.pcapng](https://gitlab.com/wireshark/wireshark/-/wikis/uploads/f6fcdceb0248669c0b057bd15d45ab6f/grpc_person_search_protobuf_with_image.pcapng):
![wireshark_grpc_protobuf_search_request](/img/wireshark_grpc_protobuf_search_request.png)
That shows searching for the Person objects of Jason and Lily based on their
names.

Since the `Search` operation is defined as the server streaming RPC mode, the
Person objects can be return back to client one after another:
![wireshark_grpc_protobuf_search_response](/img/wireshark_grpc_protobuf_search_response.png)

You may have noticed that the `portrait_image` of bytes type is parsed as a
PNG data. It's because we register the PNG dissector in the `"protobuf_field"`
dissector table for parsing the value of field `portrait_image` as picture by
putting following Lua script `'protobuf_portrait_field.lua'` into the 'plugins'
subdirectory of 'Personal configuration' directory:

```lua
do
    local protobuf_field_table = DissectorTable.get("protobuf_field")
    local png_dissector = Dissector.get("png")
    protobuf_field_table:add("tutorial.Person.portrait_image", png_dissector)
end
```

## History of gRPC and Protocol Buffers support

Here is a brief annotated list of Wireshark versions as they relate to the
support of gRPC and Protocol Buffers:

- v2.6.0: first release of gRPC and Protobuf dissectors, without
  support for `.proto` files or streaming RPCs.
- v3.2.0: improved dissection of serialized protocol buffers data based on
  `.proto` files, and support of streaming RPCs.
- v3.3.0: improved and enhanced `.proto` file support, such as capture-file
  search on protocol buffer field values.
- v3.4.0: Protocol Buffers [Timestamp][] time is displayed as locale date-time
  string.
